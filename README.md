# piKOS
Minimal OS for Raspberry Pi 3 (and 4?)

While the code in th√© `main` branch works, some work needs to be done
in its current state to clean it up--comments, style, structure--it's
all very messy (and sometimes straight-up wrong).

Note that non-debug builds currently do not work. The kernel compiles and
links properly, but hangs after boot. Obviously this needs to be fixed.
